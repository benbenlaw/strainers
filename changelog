Strainer GUI now hides upgrade icons when an item is in the slot
Mesh and input slots now show names when hovered over
Fixed grass block recipe using water instead of purifying water
Ore pieces can now be used in a strainer to create nuggets/ gems of that resource, these recipe only exist if that resource is present in the world
Output in recipes is now a SizedIngredient from this

  "output": {
    "count": 1,
    "id": "minecraft:beetroot_seeds"
  }

  to this

  "output": {
    "count": 1,
    "item": "minecraft:beetroot_seeds"
